# LABCODE
Our laboratory conducts theoretical research in areas such as deep learning, self-supervised learning, and computational intelligence. Additionally, we focus on key industrial intelligence technologies, including intelligent perception (e.g., image understanding, multimodal perception), machine autonomy (e.g., robot self-learning, autonomous planning), and process optimization and scheduling. Below are some of our research achievements:
